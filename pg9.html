  You crawl out of the wreckage of the plane. Looking around you see no sign of your friend.
  The wind is biting cold but you manage you unclip the first aid kit from its storage mount under the passenger seat. 
  You also decide to take the old flairgun mounted to the frame of the plane and hobble in what you hope is the direction of the cave.
  Success! The cave is deeper than it looked and will offer you excelent protection from the wind. 

  You sit down against the back wall of the cave and pass out once more.

  You wake to find that it is morning. The wind has calmed down and you can see a scene of devistation outside the mouth of the cave 
  with plane parts strewn all over the frozen river and its banks.

  It's a mirical you survived.

  Astrid is nowhere to be seen.
