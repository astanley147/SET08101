  The plane shakes violently as you touch down on the soft powder but the floats cut through the snow keeping the plane from 
  rolling over but you're not slowing down fast enough! 

  the plane carves along the river and careens into some trees. You are knocked unconcious. 

  You awake hours later with the worst headache of your life. Looking around you see no sign of Astrid and a hole in the fusilage 
  has apeared where her door use to be.

  Snow blows heavy in seemingly all directions around the plane.
