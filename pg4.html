  After a few hours you are almost use to the contant buffeting of the wind as you try and fly north. 

  Astrid fills the time trying to explain her teams current understanding of the Auroras. You listen as best you can but you feel like 
  you would barely follow along while sitting across a table from her let alone while trying to fly in weather like this.

  Suddenly out of nowhere, a bright green flash lights the sky. 

  Astrid starts explining that this is the start of an Aurora but you barely listen  to her as you watch in horror at the scene playing out 
  on the plane's dashboard.

  One by one the various electrical systems overload and shutdown in almost perfect timing with the pulses of light in the sky.

  You need to land. Fast.
